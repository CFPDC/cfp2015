  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <h3>Generally</h3>
  <p>
  The Catalogue for Philanthropy’s website is owned and operated by or on behalf of the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington. We take your privacy seriously, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about the information that we collect about you on our website and how we may use and disclose the information that we collect on our website. This Privacy Policy only governs information gathered from you online through the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington website.
  </p>
  <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>
We collect personal information when you register with us to create an account. We collect information volunteered by you when you do various things on our website, such as: making a donation, purchasing or redeeming a gift card, compiling a list of favorite charities, creating a gift registry, or printing your own personal Catalogue. Our web server also recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our website, but we do this solely for the sake of your security and we do not share this information with anyone and we do not use this information to customize content. You must enable cookies in your browser to check out on our website, and we will send a cookie file that (only) stores a unique, random session ID that is maintained throughout the session to track the pages you visit. We do not keep any of this information on an individualized basis, but we do keep aggregate information about users: not who visits this or that page, but how many users do, how long (in aggregate) they spend on the site, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
If you make a donation in honor of a specific person or family (such as a donation honoring a birthday, wedding, Mother’s/Father’s Day, or other special event), that person or family will be notified. If you send a Catalogue gift card to a person or family, that person’s or family’s name and other identifying information is collected by us and your name will be shared with the card recipient. By making such a donation or sending a Catalogue gift card, you represent to us that you have permission to provide and grant us the right to disclose such information to the person honored and/or to the recipient of the Gift Card. We also collect aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page views and hits throughout our website. When we collect this information we do not identify any user individually.
</p>
  <h3>Protecting Your Information</h3>
  <p>
We will never share, sell, trade, or transfer your personal information (including your e-mail address) with outside parties except those who help us operate our website or conduct our business. These outside parties have agreed to keep your information confidential. We also promise that we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized use or disclosure. For example, we do not allow unauthorized access via the Internet to the portion of our server that contains personally identifiable user information. All your credit card information is protected by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology, which encrypts data so that confidential user information, like credit card numbers, can be safely obtained. URLs that use this technology begin with “https” rather than “http”&mdash;which you will see in your browser window when you are making your secure transaction. Please know that we do not retain any end-user credit card information after processing a credit card transaction. 
 </p>
  <h3>When Disclosure of Your Information is Necessary</h3>
  <p>
As noted above, we only share your personal information with outside parties who help us operate our website or conduct our business. And we also may employ contractors to perform certain services for us. These outside parties or contractors may have access to your personal information, but may only use such information to perform services for us, and may not use it for other purposes. We may disclose your personal information if necessary, and in our good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect our rights or the rights of others.
  </p>
  <p>
  As referred to above, to the extent we collect aggregate tracking information on our website, that information would be collected without identifying any user individually. We may use this aggregated, non-identified statistical data for statistical analysis or promotional purposes.
  </p>
  <h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
  <p>
Our website contains hyperlinks to many other websites. We are not responsible for the content, functionality, or privacy polices or practices of websites to which we may provide hyperlinks on our website.
