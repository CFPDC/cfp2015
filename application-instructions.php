					<h3>Review Process &amp; Timeline</h3>
					<p>The application opens on January 5th and closes on February 27th. More than 200 charitable organizations apply to be included in the Catalogue for Philanthropy each year, and we select approximately 70 for our print Catalogue. Once applications are processed, over 100 reviewers from foundations, corporate giving programs, peer nonprofits, and the philanthropic advisory community are matched with applicants in the reviewers’ fields of expertise. Our review process (March&ndash;April) consists of three parts:</p>
					<ul class="normal">
						<li><strong>Program Review:</strong> Reviewers judge applications based on their assessment of the need each organization exists to meet, the quality of the programs it creates to meet those needs, its leadership and staffing, and the evidence of the organization’s impact. Most applications receive 5 to 8 reviews, some more than that.</li>
						<li><strong>Financial Review:</strong> A team of financial reviewers from <a href="http://www.raffa.com/">Raffa</a> assesses the financial soundness of potential finalists. Among other things, the team looks for reasonable year-to-year projections of expenses and revenue, appropriate ratios of administrative to program costs (though there is no absolute cut-off), reasonable salaries, board participation in fundraising and development, and fiscal transparency.</li>
						<li><strong>Site Visits:</strong> All reviewers are asked if they have site visited an organization within the past three years. Positive site visits confirm positive reviews. Negative site visits generate a phone call. Any organization that has not been visited by our review team will be visited by Catalogue staff.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					Our goal is to create a balanced list of great nonprofits in all fields: we don’t want all of our nonprofits to serve one category – for example all arts organizations or all programs that serve the elderly. While final decisions are editorial, they are always guided by the rankings and comments of our review team!
					</p>
					<p>
					Our vetted list of charities for the 2015-16 print Catalogue will be finalized in May and we’ll work with selected organizations to create their Catalogue features, wish lists, photos and more before the Catalogue is released in late fall, just in advance of the giving season.
