			<h3>About the Charity</h3>
			<div class="well charity-details">
				<p>
					It’s hard enough dealing with a serious illness; it’s even harder when you don’t know where to turn for support. A degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, Parkinson’s Disease strikes people of all ages, though the majority are in their 60s and up. While there is no cure, the Parkinson Foundation of the National Capital Area aims to improve the quality of life for those living with the disease, and their families. In addition to fostering a sense of community, PFNCA provides activities that are shown to slow the disease’s progression: exercise, yoga, and dance provide therapeutic movement, and a communications club and choir work on vocal cord strengthening. Additionally, it assists a network of more than 45 support groups. With services provided to more than 1,000 people annually – and the need continuing to grow — PFCNA is the only area organization that provides holistic programs year-round and helps those faced with the disease to take steps to slow its impact. Together, we can walk off Parkinson's.
