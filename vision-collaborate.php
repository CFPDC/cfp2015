			<p class="lead">We will collaborate with our partners in the philanthropic space to leverage our work and theirs and to multiply the impact that we can have together.</p>
			<p>The nonprofit sector in Greater Washington is one of the most vibrant and engaged in our nation. Through effective collaboration, we know that we can multiply our collective, positive impact on the community. In 2013, the Catalogue received grants from 10 foundations in Greater Washington, and partnered with leaders such as the Georgetown Center for Social Impact Communication, the Foundation Center, Compass Partners, and the Booz Allen Hamilton Nonprofit Speaker Series on events, funding, and capacity&dash;building initiatives.</p>
			
			<p>The Catalogue for Philanthropy was proud to be a partner of #GivingTuesday on December 3rd. #GivingTuesday is a national day of charitable giving that comes on the heels of some of the season&rsquo;s busiest shopping days of the year: Black Friday and Cyber Monday.  As an official partner, the Catalogue developed a campaign of its own (called &ldquo;#aPennySaved&rdquo;) to create buzz around this new day of giving. While shopping for loved ones on those busy days, the Catalogue asked supporters to find the best savings, deals, and steals and turn their pennies saved into pennies given to Catalogue charities.  The campaign received coverage in local print and radio outlets, with more than a dozen Catalogue charities participating. We received nearly $3,000 in donations to our charities through our website on #GivingTuesday and have plans for a much bigger event in 2014. Watch out!</p>
