				<h2 class="media-heading">Barbara Harman
				<small>President and Editor <a href="mailto:bharman@cfp-dc.org">bharman@cfp-dc.org</a></small>
				</h2>
				
				
				<p>Barbara Harman received her BA from Tufts University and MA and PhD degrees from Brandeis University. In 1977 she joined the faculty at Wellesley College where she taught English for 25 years and wrote books on Renaissance and Victorian subjects (Harvard University Press, University of Virginia Press, Garland Publishing). She became Executive Director of the Harman Family Foundation in 2000 and founded the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington in 2003. She was named Outstanding Foundation Partner by AFP in 2009 and in 2012 was named one of Washington Business Journal's Women Who Mean Business. In 2013 she received, with Jane Harman, the Mayor's Arts Award for Visionary Leadership in the Arts, and was named one of Washington's "most powerful women" by Washingtonian Magazine.</p>
				<p>Barbara enjoys living half in Boston and half in DC; she likes to walk fast (even when her balky knee hurts), work out on her arc trainer (even when her balky knee hurts), hang with her kids (when they let her), watch TV series with her husband (top three are The Wire, Six Feet Under, Friday Night Lights) and read extremely long books. Barbara also likes speaking and writing -- these days, about philanthropy.</p>

				<h2 class="media-heading">Nancy Swartz
				<small>Managing Editor &amp; Director of Special Events  <a href="mailto:nswartz@cfp-dc.org">nswartz@cfp-dc.org</a></small>
				</h2>
				
				<p>Nancy Swartz has been with the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington since 2003. Currently the Managing Editor and Events Director, she began her career as Associate Producer for Special Projects at The Good Day Show at the ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV, Channel 5 in Boston, and worked in television production and media for over twenty years. A graduate of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Mass Communication, Nancy has been a board member of the Needham Education Foundation and the Needham Friends of Music, as well as a longstanding volunteer in her community. Nancy also works as the Grants and Operations Manager for the Harman Family Foundation.</p>
				<p>In her dreams, Nancy would be on a stage in New York City singing and dancing. In the real world, she would like to someday be working in the theater department of a local college or university. For now, she couldn't be happier collaborating with a wonderful group of people that entertain her daily! When not working at the Catalogue, Nancy loves to spend time with her kids, listen to music, sing (as long as no one is listening), try to beat her parents at scrabble, read, watch movies, jog, work out, and laugh (which her husband makes her do on a regular basis)!</p>

				<h2 class="media-heading">Emma Bloksberg-Fireovid
				<small>Program Coordinator <a href="mailto:emmabf@cfp-dc.org">emmabf@cfp-dc.org</a></small>
				</h2>
				<p>Emma joined the Catalogue team in 2014 after graduating from Tufts University with a BA in Sociology. Raised in Baltimore, Emma’s passion for direct service work led her to work with inner-city youth in multiple facets: founding and operating an all-girls jump rope camp, teaching dance in Prince George’s county, and developing lesson plans for tutoring programs. Emma now uses her love of people and community engagement to manage the Catalogue nonprofit network and work on development and program initiatives for the Catalogue and its charities.</p>
				<p>After living in Costa Rica for five months, Emma speaks as much Spanish as possible and eats as many mangos and avocados as her cabinets can hold. She hopes to transport her past life as a hip-hop dancer to the DC scene and aspires to meet Ellen DeGeneres on the dance floor.</p>
