				<p class="lead">We will expand our audience through traditional and social media to raise awareness, increase visibility, and accelerate the success of our family of high-impact nonprofits.</p>
				<p>Our motive for increasing the Catalogue for Philanthropy&rsquo;s visibility is simple: when the Catalogue has a strong presence in the community, our charities win in big ways. They get more exposure to donors, volunteers, and partners who can help them broaden their impact. They are in a stronger position when they apply for grants and awards thanks to the Catalogue&rsquo;s well&dash;known vetting process and &ldquo;seal of approval.&rdquo; So, forgive us for being bold but &hellip; we&rsquo;re ready to get loud!</p>
				<p>In November, we teamed up with the Washington City Paper on <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/45081/give-it-up-dc-2013/">&ldquo;Give it Up, D.C.&rdquo;</a>  The paper&rsquo;s annual charitable giving guide featured our 2013&dash;14 CFP charities, along with their wish lists and volunteer opportunities. We celebrated the launch with a City Paper/Catalogue party at City Tap House in D.C., bringing both audiences together and toasting philanthropy in Greater Washington.  The Catalogue also partnered with Washingtonian Magazine on a full&dash;page feature in the December issue that <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/work-education/how-your-donations-to-a-charity-make-a-difference/">highlighted 26 of our charities and their wish lists.</a> Combined, the circulation of these publications put the Catalogue for Philanthropy&rsquo;s name in front of nearly 500,000 Washingtonians during the 2013 giving season! </p>
				<p>The Catalogue also grew our community of digital supporters this year with major gains in followers across social media channels and readers of our &ldquo;GoodWorks&rdquo; blog. We reached new audiences thanks to guest bloggers, such as Billy Shore of Share our Strength, who spoke of the critical importance of SNAP benefits, and the team at The Barker Foundation who shared their reflections on adoption (one of our most visited posts in 2013!). Additionally, each month more than 4,000 Catalogue supporters stay in&dash;the&dash;know about the latest CFP happenings, volunteer opportunities, events, and more through our monthly <a href="subscribe.php" title="sign up for The Catalogue for Philanthropy Newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
