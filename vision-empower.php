				<p class="lead">We will empower this network of charities with programs and materials that fulfill and extend their missions.</p>
				<p>Just because our name is &ldquo;the Catalogue&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean our work stops when the last envelope leaves the office. In fact, it means our work has just begun. With the acceptance of a new class of charities, the Catalogue&rsquo;s team is dedicated to helping each organization build on and fuel its own success through training and educational opportunities. By helping our charities become more effective at sharing stories, connecting with donors, and communicating with the public at large, we leverage the work that the Catalogue does on their behalf, and increase their ability to make our communities stronger. Below are some of the ways we do this during the year:</p>
				<div class="well">
					<blockquote>
						&ldquo;I am very excited about the terrific marketing tools and new on-line features.  What a wonderful service you are providing for the small non&dash;profit community.&rdquo;

				<p>Each year, the Catalogue for Philanthropy&hellip; </p>

				<p><b>&hellip; conducts financial workshops</b> for nearly 100 of our charity applicants to assist them with presenting their numbers in line with accepted “best practices.” These workshops, presented by our friends at Raffa PC, are designed to aid charities not only with the CFP application, but with other grant applications and donor presentations as well.</p>

				<p><b>&hellip; empowers our nonprofits with marketing and communications tools</b> such as <a href="http://www.gazette.net/article/20131226/NEWS/131229583/1010/casa-prince-george-x2019-s-listed-in-philanthropy-guide&amp;template=gazette">press releases</a>, <a href="http://www.501ctech.org/501ctech-featured-in-catalogue-for-philanthropy-as-one-of-the-best-local-charities-in-greater-washington/">announcements</a>, and online fundraising templates. Thanks to the tools provided in the Catalogue’s Nonprofit Portal, our charities can easily share news with grantmakers, donors, volunteers, and media outlets in their community.</p>

				<p><b>&hellip; presents &ldquo;The Art of the Thank You&rdquo;</b> to educate charities on the do's and don'ts of thanking donors. Using real examples from CFP charities, Catalogue President and Editor Barbara Harman draws on her experience as a philanthropist, charity director, and former English professor to share helpful tips for writing thoughtful and powerful thank&dash;you letters.</p>

				<p><b>&hellip; and the beat goes on.</b> Throughout year we also offer training sessions on Marketing and Communications, and new workshops on Donor Stewardship.</p>
