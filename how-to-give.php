		<h2>Join the Movement</h2>

			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7">
				<p>If you believe in what we&rsquo;re doing&mdash;making &ldquo;give where you live&rdquo; a meaningful reality&mdash;then join the movement! Consider <a class="need-page" href="checkout.php">making a gift</a> to the Catalogue. Because we don&rsquo;t charge any fees to our nonprofits, and we don&rsquo;t take any percentage of donations to our charities, the Catalogue relies on the support of passionate, community&dash;minded people like you to keep our vision alive. For every dollar we raise, we generate five dollars for our featured charities. That&rsquo;s a pretty great return on investment. And we&rsquo;re a public charity too!</p>
