				<p class="lead">We will engage the best minds in our community, pooling their knowledge to evaluate applicant charities and help us select the very best.</p>
				
				<p>We all approach charitable giving with the best intentions, but the truth is that exercising due diligence before making a donation is no small endeavor. Donors are always encouraged to analyze a charityâ€™s finances, examine its programs, visit the site, and talk to the leaders &hellip; but between work, family, and other commitments, who has the time?</p>

					<blockquote>
						&ldquo;The selection process for the Catalogue for Philanthropy is really rigorous, so being selected is truly an honor. It demonstrates that we are having an impact on the community &hellip; and it puts us in the limelight.&rdquo;

				<p>This is why each year the Catalogue sets out to do the important work of vetting&ndash;so our donors don&rsquo;t have to. We do this by relying on a <a href="cfp-reviewers.php">&ldquo;community of knowledge&rdquo;</a> to evaluate our nonprofit applicants. Harnessing the brainpower of this community we can <a href="vetting.php">look beyond the traditional metrics of evaluation</a> and ask questions that people don&rsquo;t always think to ask, or know how to assess: What need is a charity meeting? Is it doing so with excellence? Are its finances sound? What impact, tangible or intangible, is it having on the community it serves? This is how we determine which nonprofits are truly among &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; </p>
				<p>In 2013, 74 charities across Greater Washington (out of 200+ applicants) earned this distinction in the Catalogue for Philanthropy.</p>
