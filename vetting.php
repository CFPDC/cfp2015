					<li><strong>Program Review:</strong> <a href="cfp-reviewers.php">Reviewers</a> judge applications based on their assessment of the need	each organization exists to meet, the quality of the programs it creates to meet those needs, its leadership and staffing, and the evidence of the organization&rsquo;s impact. Most applications	receive 5 to 8 reviews, some more than that.</li>
					<li><strong>Financial Review:</strong> A team of financial reviewers from Raffa, PC assesses the financial soundness of potential finalists.  Among other things, the team looks for reasonable year&dash;to&dash;year projections of expenses and revenue, appropriate ratios of administrative to program costs (though there is no absolute cut&dash;off), reasonable salaries, board participation in fundraising and development, and fiscal transparency.</li>
					<li><strong>Site Visits:</strong> All reviewers are asked if they have site visited an organization within the past three years. Positive site visits confirm positive reviews. Negative site visits generate a phone call. Any organization that has not been visited by our review team will be visited by Catalogue staff. </li>

				<p>Our goal is to create a balanced list of great nonprofits in all fields: we don&rsquo;t want all of our nonprofits to serve one category&ndash;for example all arts organizations or all programs that serve the elderly. While final decisions are editorial, they are always guided by the rankings and comments of our review team!</p>
