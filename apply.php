				<h3>Who We Are: An Overview</h3>
				<p>The mission of the Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington is to create strong and vibrant communities by connecting caring citizens with worthy community causes. For donors&sbquo; this means we take the guesswork out of giving by identifying the best community-based charities in Washington D.C. and nearby Maryland and Virginia. For our nonprofits&sbquo; we raise visibility through the distribution of our annual print Catalogue&sbquo; events&sbquo; and campaigns&sbquo; and we create resources and run educational workshops throughout the year to help them elevate their capacity to do good.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="col-xs-12"><small>PLEASE NOTE: The Catalogue is NOT a grant-making organization. To facilitate the giving process for donors&sbquo; we accept donations on behalf of our charities and pass them on to our nonprofits&sbquo; but make no direct contributions or donations to any of our charities. We charge no fees for the work we do and are supported entirely by outside donations.</small></p>
			<div class="col-xs-12">
				<h3>Why Apply</h3>
				<p>Being part of our network means you&rsquo;ll be recognized as &ldquo;one of the best&rdquo; high-impact&sbquo; community-based nonprofits in our region&mdash;something that means so much to supporters&sbquo; both existing and new. While we do not guarantee a specific financial benefit&sbquo; our track record shows that when nonprofits engage in a committed partnership with us&sbquo; they receive both financial and other returns. (The Catalogue has helped raise over $25 million since 2003.) </p>
